    - Add Creator section in tcx. by Carlroth, issue #22
 - 2012-02-25
    - setup tools, automated installer
	- check version# of config file, and generate warning if
	  file might not be backward compatible
	- config file must exist in ~/.antd
 - 2012-02-19
 	- fix bug where burst transfers may fail do to incorrect sequence
	  numbers. (0 should only be used for first packet)
	- merged branch 'multidevice': multi-device suppport
		- old known devices dbm is incompatable, you will need to repair
		- some configuration updated, tcx, raw, etc now write to path
		  which includes device serial number. It is recommended you
		  use latest configuration file. Update if you've copied it 
		  to ~/.antd.
		- pairing is only accepted when not running in daemon mode.
		  This seems to make sense because otherwise, the background
		  process would potentially drain battery of unparied devices
		  which are found in range.
		- updated antfs search code, can search for a device with specfic
		  serial numbers. prerequisites to implementing uploads.
